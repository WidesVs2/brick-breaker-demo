        <p class="lead">I'm using this as a demonstration / proving grounds for javascript coding ability. I hope you've enjoyed playing this simple brick breaker as much as I enjoyed creating it. If you discover obvious glithces or nasty bugs, two things to remeber...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Those aren't bugs, they're features...</li>
            <li>Wreck it Ralph taught us to cherish glitches...</li>

        </ul>
        <p class="lead">As time progresses, I'll be adding more and more features and cleaning up problems. As such, please consider this an alpha version. Some variance is to be expected at this stage of development.</p>
        <p class="lead">Thanks again for playing my game, have a great time!</p>

        <p class="lead">A lot of people deserve thanks for their help. First, to my loving and wonderful wife, Amanda. You've stuck by me through some real crap, and it's only because of your encouragement that I ever accomplish anything. I love you Darling! Second, <a href="https://chrisperko.net" referrerpolicy="noreferrer" target="_blank">Chris Perko</a> from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" referrerpolicy="noreferrer" target="_blank">FreeCodeCamp.org</a>, who created the base tutorial I followed to get started. Most of what I had done in Version 0.0.1 came from this tutorial. Thanks for making such an awesome course! Look it up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EMxBkqC4z0" referrerpolicy="noreferrer" target="_blank">HERE</a>. Thirdly, thanks to all my friends who were the very first testers of this game. You guys really pushed me to make this more than just a finished tutorial. Thanks guys! Lastly, there are a couple of creators that I used resources from that deserve their due.</p>
        <ul>Resources:
            <li>Sounds: Eric Matyas from <a href="https://soundimage.org/" referrerpolicy="noreferrer" target="_blank">soundimage.org</a></li>
            <li>Images: Images were drawn by me, however my artistic ability is pretty much zilch, so the real credit goes to the creators of <a href="https://www.pixilart.com/" referrerpolicy="noreferrer" target="_blank">pixilart.com</a> for creating such an easy to use Pixel Art creator.</li>
